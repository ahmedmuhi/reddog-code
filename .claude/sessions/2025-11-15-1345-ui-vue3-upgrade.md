# Session: UI Vue 3 Upgrade

**Started:** 2025-11-15 13:45 NZDT
**Status:** In Progress

## Goals
- Upgrade the Vue.js UI from Vue 2 to Vue 3 following `plan/upgrade-ui-vue3-implementation-1.md`.
- Ensure the plan aligns with current ADRs and recent CI/CD learnings (GHCR-first images, tooling audit workflows).
- Resolve the `node-sass`/Node 24 incompatibility by adopting the modern build stack (Vue CLI or Vite + `sass`).

## Initial Tasks
1. Review the existing upgrade plan (`plan/upgrade-ui-vue3-implementation-1.md`) and note any outdated steps or assumptions.
2. Cross-check the plan against ADRs and recent documentation updates (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) to confirm there are no conflicts.
3. Capture the current UI workflow/tooling issues (node-sass, npm audit) as explicit requirements for the upgrade.
4. Define next actions (dependency updates, tooling changes, CI adjustments) before editing code.

## Progress Log
- *2025-11-15 13:45 NZDT* – Session created. Goals drafted (Vue 3 upgrade, align with ADRs, unblock CI). Next step: review `plan/upgrade-ui-vue3-implementation-1.md`.
- *2025-11-15 14:05 NZDT* – Phase 1 sanity check complete (`npm run dev` boots Vite without compile errors). Confirmed `src/main.ts` already uses `createApp` + `app.use(...)`. Replaced the old Vue Router 3 entry (`src/router/index.js`) with a TS-based Vue Router 4 version (`src/router/index.ts`).

## Next Steps
- Read the UI upgrade plan and list required updates.
- Identify blockers (legacy dependencies, build tooling) and map them to ADRs/standards.
- Outline the implementation path (dependency changes, build/test updates, workflow adjustments).
